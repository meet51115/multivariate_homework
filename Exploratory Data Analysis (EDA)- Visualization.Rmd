#univariate
#What is the distribution of employee ages?
hist(IBM$Age, main="Distribution of Age", xlab="Age", ylab="Frequency", col="skyblue", border="black")
#The histogram illustrates the frequency distribution of ages among employees in the dataset.
#It provides a visual representation of how age is distributed within the sample population.
#The range of ages covered by the dataset can be observed from the histogram.
#This helps in understanding the diversity of age groups represented in the dataset.

#bivariate
#Is there a relationship between monthly income and education level?
boxplot(IBM$MonthlyIncome ~ IBM$Education, main = "Monthly Income by Education Level", xlab = "Education Level", ylab = "Monthly Income")
#The boxplot shows the distribution of Monthly Income for each Education Level category.
#It allows for a comparison of income levels among individuals with different educational backgrounds.
#Any noticeable trends or patterns in the distribution of Monthly Income across Education Levels can be identified.
#For instance, there may be a gradual increase or decrease in income with higher levels of education, or certain Education Fields may exhibit higher income levels compared to others.

#This stacked bar plot visualizes the distribution of Work Life Balance across different Education Fields, segmented by Department.
#It helps to compare the distribution of Work Life Balance within each Education Field across different Departments.
