#Summary has three sections. Section1: How well does the model fit the data (before Coefficients). Section2: Is the hypothesis supported? (until sifnif codes). Section3: How well does data fit the model (again).

#R-square of this model is 0.4006, which is not closer to 1. So we can say that this model is not a perfect fit.
#Also the significance level is 95% for this model, i.e alpha = 0.05. Here the p-value<alpha. Hence, it is insignificant
#Data fits moderately in the model.

#Interpretation from Durbin Watson Test:
#The D-W statistic (2.04) falls within the inconclusive zone (typically between 1.5 and 2.5). This makes it difficult to definitively reject or accept the null hypothesis.
#The p-value (0.374) is greater than significance level 0.05. This suggests that we fail to reject the null hypothesis at this significance level.


#Residual Analysis: The QQ plot shows a slight curvature, particularly in the tails. The tails of the data points fall slightly outside the diagonal reference line, suggesting that the residuals might have heavier tails than a normal distribution. This indicates potential non-normality.
